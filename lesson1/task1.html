    <h2>Reasons to love bullfinches:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>they are easy to tame and are not afraid of humans</li>
        <li>live in areas with trees only</li>
        <li>fast eaters - can eat up to 30 flowers buds in a minute</li>
        <li>3 weeks old chicks are ready to live separately already</li>
        <li>tiny birds - their weight reaches up to 30 g</li>
